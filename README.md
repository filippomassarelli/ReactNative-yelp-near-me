# Project 2 - *Yelp fusion API*

## Overview

This project is a simple Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search).

You can search anything from restaurants to libraries, bars and events. 

The objective of this project was to learn React Native and practice fetching data from APIs.
